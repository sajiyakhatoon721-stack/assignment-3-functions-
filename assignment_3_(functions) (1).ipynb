        " Q4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "         -> the return statement in a function is used to send a value back to the caller of the function. It serves several key purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "         * Outputting Results: The primary purpose is to allow a function to produce a result that can be used by other parts of the program. Without a return statement, a function that performs a calculation or process would complete its tasks, but the outcome of those tasks wouldn't be accessible outside of the function's scope.\n",
        "         Exiting the Function: When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops executing, and control is returned to the point where the function was called. Any code within the function after the return statement will not be executed.\n",
        "         * Returning None by Default: If a function doesn't have a return statement, or if it has a return statement without a value, it implicitly returns None.\n",
        "         Here are some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "          Example 1: Returning a calculated value\n",

        "        In this example, add_numbers calculates the sum of a and b and then uses return sum_result to send that sum back to the line where add_numbers was called. The returned value is then stored in the total variable.\n",

        "        Example 2: Exiting the function early\n",
        "\n",
        "        def check_positive(number):\n",

        "      print(person_info[1])   # Output: 30\n",

        "      Functions can return multiple values by listing them after the return statement, separated by commas. These values are automatically packed into a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Q5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "     ->Iterable: An iterable is an object that can be looped over or iterated through. This means it can return its elements one by one. Examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. You can use a for loop directly on an iterable.\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "     for item in my_list:  my_list is an iterable\n",
        "     print(item)\n",
        "     Iterator: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It's what actually performs the iteration. An iterator has a __next__() method that returns the next item in the sequence. When there are no more items, it raises a StopIteration exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "     You can get an iterator from an iterable using the iter() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "      my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "      my_iterator = iter(my_list)  Get an iterator from the list\n",
        "\n",
        "      print(next(my_iterator))  Output: 1\n",
        "      print(next(my_iterator))  Output: 2\n",
        "      print(next(my_iterator))  Output: 3\n",
        "      print(next(my_iterator))  Output: 4\n",
        "      print(next(my_iterator)) This would raise StopIteration\n",
        "      Key Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "     What they are: An iterable is a container that can be iterated, while an iterator is an object that performs the iteration.\n",
        "     * Methods: Iterables have an __iter__() method (which returns an iterator). Iterators have both an __iter__() method (which returns the iterator itself) and a __next__() method.\n",
        "     * State: Iterators maintain state – they know where they are in the sequence. Iterables do not maintain this state themselves; they provide an iterator to do so.\n",
        "     * One-time use: Iterators are generally consumed as you iterate. Once you've gone through all the items, you can't go back unless you create a new iterator from the iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "            -> Generators: Generators are a special type of function that allows you to create iterators in a more straightforward way. They \"generate\" values on the fly as you iterate over them, rather than building a complete list or sequence in memory. This makes them very memory-efficient, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "     How they are defined:\n",
        "     Generators are defined like regular functions using the def keyword, but instead of using the return statement to return a value and exit, they use the yield keyword to produce a sequence of values. When yield is encountered, the function's state is frozen, and the value is returned. When next() is called on the generator again, execution resumes from where it left off.\n",
        "     Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      def simple_generator():\n",
        "      yield 1\n",
        "      yield 2\n",
        "      yield 3\n",
        "\n",
        "       Create a generator object\n",
        "      gen = simple_generator()\n",
        "\n",
        "      Iterate over the generator\n",
        "     print(next(gen))  Output: 1\n",
        "     print(next(gen))  Output: 2\n",
        "     print(next(gen))  Output: 3\n",
        "     print(next(gen))  This would raise StopIteration\n",
        "     In this example, simple_generator is a generator function. When we call it, it returns a generator object (gen). Calling next() on the generator object resumes the function's execution until the next yield statement is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Generators are often used in for loops, which automatically handle the iteration and the StopIteration exception:\n",
        "\n",

        "      This generator count_up_to yields numbers from 1 up to n. It doesn't create a list of all numbers in memory at once; it generates them one by one as the for loop requests them.\n",
